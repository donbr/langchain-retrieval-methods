The data is stored in database tables with rows, columns, and keys, and used for application storage like e-commerce websites. As the CTO for Tailwind Traders, you're responsible for designing databases for Azure to support existing structured data on-premises. You're looking for a storage solution to support existing data and future relational data workloads initiated by the company.\nWithin the umbrella of the Azure SQL platform, there are many AI-ready deployment options and choices to consider. This video reviews five options that give you the flexibility to get and pay for exactly what you need in your storage solution.\n\nAzure SQL Database\nIn this unit, we look at Azure SQL Database and SQL Database elastic pools. In the following units, we examine SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, along with Azure SQL Managed Instance and instance pools.\nAzure SQL Database is a PaaS deployment option of Azure SQL that abstracts both the OS and the SQL Server instance. An Azure SQL database is a fully managed service. You don't have to deal with complex database tasks like configuring and managing high availability, tuning, and backups. The service automatically upgrades each SQL database to run the most recent version of SQL Server. You get the latest SQL Server capabilities without having to perform manual updates.\nThings to know about Azure SQL Database\nReview the following characteristics of the SQL Database deployment option:\n\nIt's a highly scalable, intelligent, relational database service built for the cloud with the industry's highest availability.\n\nSQL Database is the only deployment option that supports scenarios that require large databases (currently up to 100 TB) or autoscaling for unpredictable workloads (serverless).\n\nYou can create a SQL Database elastic database pool, where all databases in the pool share the same set of compute and storage resources. Each database can use the resources it needs, within the limits you set, depending on current load.\n\nThere are two primary pricing options for SQL Database: DTU and vCore. A serverless option is also available for a single database.\n\n\n\nvCore: A vCore is a virtual core. You choose the number of virtual cores and have greater control over your compute costs. This option supports the Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server and reserved capacity (pay in advance).\n\nDTU: A DTU (Database Transaction Unit) is a combined measure of compute, storage, and I/O resources. The DTU option is an easy, preconfigured purchase option.\n\nServerless: A compute tier for single databases in SQL Database. The serverless model automatically scales compute, based on workload demand, and bills only for the amount of compute used.\n\n\n\n\nBusiness scenario\nLet's explore a business scenario for Azure SQL Database. AccuWeather has been analyzing and predicting the weather for more than 55 years. The company chose the Azure platform for its big data, machine learning, and AI capabilities. AccuWeather wants to focus on building new models and applications, not on managing databases. The company chose SQL Database to use with other services, like Azure Data Factory and Azure Machine Learning to quickly and easily deploy new internal applications to make sales and customer predictions.\n\n\nThings to consider when using Azure SQL Database\nConsider how Azure SQL Database can be included in your relational data storage plan for Tailwind Traders:\n\nConsider vCore pricing. (Microsoft recommended) Select compute and storage resources independently for multiple SQL databases or an elastic database pool. Use Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server or reserved capacity (pay in advance) to save money. You control the compute and storage resources that you create and pay for.\n\nConsider DTU pricing. Choose this easy, preconfigured purchase plan for a bundled measure of compute, storage, and I/O resources to support multiple SQL databases. This option isn't available for Azure SQL Managed Instance.\n\nConsider serverless option. Use the serverless compute tier for a single SQL database. You're billed only for the amount of compute used.\n\nConsider elastic database pools. Buy a set of compute and storage resources to share among all SQL databases in an elastic pool. For more information, see SQL elastic pools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWas this page helpful?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nen-us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Light \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dark \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n High contrast \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Versions\n \nBlog\n \nContribute\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nTrademarks\n\n© Microsoft 2025\n\n\n\n\n",

As with Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance is a fully managed service. It provides an instance of SQL Server, but removes much of the overhead of managing a virtual machine. You can deploy a single managed instance or a managed instance pool.\n\n\nThings to know about Azure SQL Managed Instance\nReview the following characteristics of the SQL Managed Instance deployment option.\n\nYou can use SQL Managed Instance to do lift-and-shift migrations to Azure without having to redesign your applications.\n\nAzure SQL Managed Instance is ideal for customers interested in instance-scoped features, such as SQL Server Agent, Common language runtime (CLR), Database Mail, Distributed transactions, and Machine Learning Services.\n\nSQL Managed Instance uses vCores mode. You can define the maximum CPU cores and maximum storage allocated to your managed instance. All databases within the managed instance share the resources allocated to the instance.\n\nMost of the features available in SQL Server are available in SQL Managed Instance. Review this comparison of SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance.\n\n\nBusiness scenario\nLet's explore a business scenario for Azure SQL Managed Instance. Komatsu is a manufacturing company that produces and sells heavy equipment for construction. The company had multiple mainframe applications for different types of data. Komatsu wants to consolidate these applications to get an overall view. Additionally, Komatsu wants a way to reduce overhead. Because the company uses a large surface area of SQL Server features, the IT department wants to move to Azure SQL Managed Instance. They were able to move about 1.5 TB of data smoothly and gained many benefits. With the deployment to Azure SQL Managed Instance, the company gains automatic patching and version updates, automated backups, high availability, and reduced management overhead.\n\n\nThings to consider when using Azure SQL Managed Instance\nConsider how Azure SQL Managed Instance can be included in your relational data storage plan for Tailwind Traders:\n\nConsider instance-scoped features. Use instance-scoped features of Azure SQL Managed Instance like Service Broker, CLR, SQL Server Agent, and Linked servers. Migrate your relational and structured data to Azure without rearchitecting your applications.\n\nConsider instance scalability. Add scalability for your instance by enabling vCores mode. You can define the maximum CPU cores and storage for your instances, so all databases in the instance share the same resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWas this page helpful?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nen-us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Light \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dark \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n High contrast \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Versions\n \nBlog\n \nContribute\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nTrademarks\n\n© Microsoft 2025\n\n\n\n\n",

This service lets you use full versions of SQL Server in the cloud without having to manage your on-premises machines. Azure VMs come in many sizes and can be run in diverse geographic regions. Each SQL Server VM can be created to meet specific version and operating system requirements, which make them a good option for handling different SQL Server workloads.\nThings to know about SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines\nReview the following characteristics of the SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines deployment option:\n\nWhen you run SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, you have access to the full capabilities of SQL Server.\n\nAll of your SQL Server skills should directly transfer during the migration, and Azure can help automate backups and security patches.\n\nUnlike the Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment options, you're responsible for version update operations for the OS and SQL Server.\n\n\nBusiness scenario\nLet's explore a business scenario for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. AllScripts is a leading manufacturer of healthcare software. The company serves physician practices, hospitals, health plans, and the pharmaceutical industry. To transform its applications frequently, and host them securely and reliably, AllScripts wants to quickly move its data to Azure. In just three weeks, the company used Azure Site Recovery to migrate dozens of acquired applications running on approximately 1,000 VMs to Azure.\n\n\nThings to consider when using SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines\nConsider how SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines can be included in your relational data storage plan for Tailwind Traders:\n\nConsider server access. Access your SQL Server and operating system server by implementing SQL Server on your virtual machines. Expansive support is provided for SQL Server and operating system versions.\n\nConsider automated management.

After reviewing the five deployment options, you decide to implement Azure SQL Database for its fully managed service features. You're hoping to gain the high availability SLA offered in the Business Critical service tier when using availability zones.\nYour next decision is how to support scalability for a relational database. You need a dynamically scalable solution that can handle an expanding number of requests over time without a negative effect on availability or performance.\n\nAzure SQL Database and dynamic scalability\nAzure SQL Database supports dynamic scalability. You can easily change resources allocated to your databases, such as CPU power, memory, I/O throughput, and storage with minimal downtime. Use the Azure portal to scale an Azure SQL Database without changing the existing infrastructure or purchasing new hardware.\nThings to know about dynamic scalability\nReview the following characteristics of dynamic scalability for an Azure SQL database:\n\nChoose DTU or vCore models, and define the maximum amount of resources to assign to each database with a single database implementation.\n\nUse elastic database pools, and purchase resources for the group, and set minimum and maximum resource limits for the databases within the pool.\n\nImplement vertical or horizontal scaling:\n\nVertical: Increase or decrease the compute size of an individual database, also called scaling up. Implement vertical scaling by using SQL Database elastic database pools. When you have low average utilization, but infrequent, high utilization spikes, you can allocate enough capacity in the pool to manage the spikes for the group.\n\nHorizontal: Add or remove databases to adjust capacity or overall performance, also called scaling out. Apply horizontal scaling by using sharding to partition data or read scale-out provisioning.\n\n\n\n\nBusiness scenario\nLet's explore a business scenario for using vertical scaling. A small business experiences rapid growth globally. The company needs to maintain and scale separate SQL databases for each location. The rates of growth and database load vary significantly. Resource requirements are unpredictable. The ideal dynamic scaling solution is to use SQL elastic database pools with vertical scaling. You can scale, manage performance, and manage costs for a set of SQL databases. For more information, see SQL elastic database pools.\n\n\n\n\nThings to consider when choosing scalability solutions\nReview the following scaling scenarios, and think about which database scaling strategy can work for Tailwind Traders.\n\n\n\nScenario\nScaling solution\n\n\n\n\nManage and scale multiple Azure SQL databases that have varying and unpredictable resource requirements\nElastic database pools and vertical scaling. Use elastic database pools to ensure databases get the performance resources they need when they need it. Elastic pools provide a simple resource allocation mechanism within a predictable budget. There's no per-database charge for elastic pools. You're billed for each hour a pool exists at the highest eDTU or vCores, regardless of usage or whether the pool was active for less than an hour.\n\n\nDifferent sections of a database reside in different geographic locations for compliance reasons\nHorizontal scaling and sharding. Use sharding to split your data into several databases and scale them independently. The shard map manager is a special database that maintains global mapping information about all shards (databases) in a shard set. The metadata allows an application to connect to the correct database based on the value of the sharding key.\n\n\nDependency support for commercial BI or data integration tools, where multiple databases contribute rows into a single overall result for use in Excel, Power BI, or Tableau\nElastic database tools and elastic query. Use the Elastic database tools elastic query feature to access data spread across multiple databases. Elastic query is available on the Standard tier. Querying can be done in T-SQL that spans multiple databases in Azure SQL Database. Run cross-database queries to access remote tables, and to connect tools (Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and so on) and query across data tiers. You can scale out queries to large data tiers and visualize the results in business intelligence reports.\n\n\n\n\nTip\nContinue your learning in the Scale multiple Azure SQL Databases with SQL elastic pools training module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWas this page helpful?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nen-us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Light \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dark \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n High contrast \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Versions\n \nBlog\n \nContribute\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nTrademarks\n\n© Microsoft 2025\n\n\n\n\n",
